# Git Repository Migration Script

This Bash script allows you to migrate a repository from a source platform (e.g., GitLab) to a target platform (e.g., Bitbucket). It clones the source repository as a mirror, pushes it to the target repository, and optionally pushes a specific branch to the target repository.

## Usage

```bash
bash clone_repo.sh <Source_Repo_URL> <Target_Repo_URL> <Branch_Name>

```
